## üìñ About the Project

**NLW Agents** is a full-stack application (Frontend and Backend) created to manage "agents" and their interactions, using AI for audio transcription and response generation. The project was built during the **Next Level Week** event by [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/), with the goal of applying modern web development practices.

### ‚ú® Main Features

- **Reactive Web Interface**: Built with React, Vite, and TypeScript for a modern user experience.
- **Robust API**: Backend server developed with Node.js and Fastify for high performance.
- **AI-powered Database**: Uses PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension for similarity search.
- **AI Integration with Gemini**: Leverages Google's Gemini API for audio transcription, embeddings generation, and intelligent responses.
- **Data Validation**: Uses Zod to ensure data integrity end to end.
- **Containerized Environment**: Docker-based setup for quick database initialization.
